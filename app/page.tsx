        Suum is a project I'm in the early stages of, which is a stablecoin-based Patreon alternative. Patreon has high fees, including payment transaction fees, which, for a small $5-a-month creator, essentially doubles the platform fee from an already high 8% to an outrageous 16%. Stablecoins keep that at 8%, but I also intend to lower the platform fees for early creators and increase prices as they scale to accelerate the platform early on. Iâ€™m passively building the MVP while gauging creator interest before going all in.

        This idea came to me one day when I was playing Civilization after OpenAI&apos;s Sora was having a big publicity day. It&apos;s a pretty wacky idea, but essentially, I hope in a few years, it will be possible to build a tool that can record your video game sessions in games like Civilization, Factorio, Starcraft, or other turn-based strategy games and turn them into an AI-generated film with a storyline.

    Why I Fell in Love with Building in 2024
  </motion.h2>

  <div className="space-y-2">
    <AnimatedParagraph>
      I posted a tweet back in October after about a month or so of real programming. At this moment, I felt this borderline ethereal feeling when programming clicked for me, and I started to see it in a different way, a way I love.
    </AnimatedParagraph>

    <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.2}>
      <em>"As I become better at programming, I understand the connection Paul Graham makes in terms of hackers and painters. Coding really is creating art on a blank canvas. Both in looks and functionality, which I think makes it like a combination of art and music. It&apos;s really beautiful, quite honestly."</em>
    </AnimatedParagraph>

    <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.4}>
    I&apos;ve never really been a great artist, nor taken any engineering courses in college (my love for tech was discovered the second semester of my senior year, unfortunately), so when I started building nufriends, it was the first time I actually put thoughts in my head into something real in the world, and I was thrilled.     </AnimatedParagraph>

    <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.6}>
    It was a genuinely emotional experience when I started playing around with Replit Agent and Claude Sonnet 3.5 and realized that if I know what I want, I can build it. I still remember where I was sitting in the Hunter&apos;s Point Public Library; I was so excited I teared up. Since I started building in September 2024, I&apos;ve pushed over 35,000 lines of code across a full-stack mobile app, three websites (including this one), and a few burgeoning projects.    </AnimatedParagraph>

    <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.8}>
    I love building software products because it&apos;s a way to impact many lives all around the world. It&apos;s inspiring. I quickly learned through building that I most enjoyed UX design and frontend development. Again, I felt this artistic craftsmanship when coding in TS, CSS, HTML, Tailwind, Framer Motion, and so on. What enhanced this love was when I began putting myself in the user&apos;s shoes to understand them and what they need.    </AnimatedParagraph>

    <AnimatedParagraph delay={1.0}>
    What will their journey be like? What should the first screen they see be? How much guidance is too much guidance in onboarding? What should they figure out on their own? What do I want the user to feel in this exact moment, and how do I ensure they feel that way? How can I push the user towards premium subscriptions without being overly aggressive? How do I build trust through my product design?    </AnimatedParagraph>

    <AnimatedParagraph delay={1.2}>
    I love questions, and I love that UX design allows me to ask as many questions as possible to myself and to potential users to create something that truly is art and music working symbiotically into something beautiful.    </AnimatedParagraph>

          Well, as I hope you assumed based on my previous answer, I have a strong love for the craft.
          </AnimatedParagraph>

          <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.2}>
          I feel the most focused in my life when solving a problem, and coding is simply asking yourself or others about problems and designing solutions for them. I love finishing a page or component, but I love the incremental steps towards that finished product even moreâ€”when you realize what it will look like and how beautiful it will be.          </AnimatedParagraph>

          <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.4}>
          So, you will get someone who loves asking questions and solving problems, is almost never satisfied and always striving for something better, is a fast learner (0-35,000 lines of self-taught code in four months), and is passionate about delighting users.          </AnimatedParagraph>

          <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.6}>
          You will get something that will integrate effortlessly with your team and will never waste an opportunity to ask questions and learn. The growth I&apos;ve experienced since September with my coding abilities has been a blast, and I know with the right team and mission around me, I&apos;ll continue to progress rapidly.          </AnimatedParagraph>

          <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.8}>
          I love building. Therefore, if the job requires 12 hours of building a day, wonderful. If it only requires 8-10, no problem, I&apos;ll spend an extra 2-4 hours a day building projects of my own and improving my skills. This is what I do for fun (when not playing Civilization), so I expect to continue growing quickly while delivering immediate results for your company.           </AnimatedParagraph>

        <AnimatedParagraph>
        As you&apos;ll see in my videos, I analyze everything on a page deeplyâ€”why each button is where it is, why I received this notification, how they got me to opt into notifications, how to increase conversions by changing language, moving buttons, changing colors, or adding animations. I truly think about everything, and I will constantly ask my coworkers and, if possible, our users what they think about every detail and strongly consider all feedback to make a decision.        </AnimatedParagraph>

        <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.2}>
        I have talked to several users in building nufriends, and have read so many app reviews, including some of my own (which include 40+ minute videos/rants), so I know what to consider, and I know what to look for. Nothing I do is just to get something done; every change I make is with the user in mind. Every color, button, animation, text, and whatever else on a page is a considered decision.        </AnimatedParagraph>

        <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.4}>
        I take nothing personally and always look to improve, so I welcome as much feedback and/or criticism as I can get. I love to learn, and feedback in this function is the best way by far.        </AnimatedParagraph>

        <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.6}>
        Everyone knows a great UX designer must be creative, and the best way to be creative is to seek inspiration. I took inspiration for this site by looking at dozens of other UX designer portfolios, including the welcome animation from Runway (A site I love). This desire to learn and hold myself accountable for improving in the craft is why I started User Journeys. I intend to improve quickly, and I can&apos;t imagine how much better I&apos;ll be even a year from now, based on how much I&apos;ve grown in such a short amount of time.         </AnimatedParagraph>

        <AnimatedParagraph delay={0.8}>
        I am analytical, empathetic, a deep thinker, creative, and a passionate builder. I believe, and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll agree, that these are excellent traits for a UX designer.        </AnimatedParagraph>

        What I Hope to Improve

      I intend to begin studying this on my own, as I have to some extent, but in my next role, I hope to ask my co-workers who excel in graphic design, typography, colors, and so on millions of questions regarding why they made every decision they did. I&apos;m very creative, though not naturally artistic, so the visual design side of the craft is something I&apos;m still developing. Though I&apos;m learning independently, I&apos;m eager to learn directly from someone who is excellent in this aspect of product design.
